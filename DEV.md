# Rust
## Rust Installation and First Program

First, download Rust using `rustup`, a command-line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. [See the official guide for installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To install Rust, run:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

The installation script automatically adds Rust to your system PATH after the next login. If you want to start using Rust right away, run:
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Create a sample "Hello World" program in a file named `main.rs`:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

To compile and run the program, use:
```bash
rustc main.rs
```

This step requires a linker, such as `gcc`, which is included in the `build-essential` package on Linux. After compilation, an executable file named `main` (or `main.exe` on Windows) will be created. Run the executable with:
```bash
./main
```

This will output:
```
Hello, world!
```

## Cargo

Cargo is the build system and package manager for Rust. It simplifies the management of Rust projects by automating tasks such as building code, downloading dependencies, and compiling those dependencies. **Cargo** is included with the Rust installation.

To check the version of Cargo, use:
```bash
cargo --version
```

### Creating a Project Using Cargo
To create a new project with Cargo:
```bash
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world
```
The first command creates a new directory and project named *hello_world*. This project includes a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` directory containing a `main.rs` file.

### Building and Running a Cargo Project
To build the project, run:
```bash
cargo build
```
This command generates an executable in *target/debug/hello_world*, rather than the current directory. The default build is a debug build, so Cargo places the binary in the debug directory:
```bash
./target/debug/hello_world
```
Running `cargo build` for the first time also creates a *Cargo.lock* file at the top level, which keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in the project. There's no need to manually edit this file; Cargo manages it automatically.

To compile the code and run the executable in one step, use:
```bash
cargo run
```
Cargo will track changes in the source files, rebuild the project if changes are detected, and then run the binary.

Cargo also provides a command to quickly check your code for compilation without producing an executable:
```bash
cargo check
```

### Building for Release
When the project is ready for release, compile it with optimizations using:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
This will create the executable in *target/release* instead of *target/debug*.

### Understanding a Basic Rust Program
```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Please input your name");

    let mut name = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut name)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("Hello World {name}")
}
```

To obtain user input and print the result as output, we need to bring the `io` (input/output) library into scope. Rust includes a set of items in the standard library called the **prelude**, which is automatically brought into the scope of every program. More details can be found in the [standard library documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html).

If a type we need is not in the prelude, we must explicitly bring it into scope with a `use` statement.

#### Storing Values with Variables
We create a variable to store user input with:
```rust
let mut name = String::new();
```

Using `let`, we create a variable, like `let num = 5;`, which creates a variable named `num` and assigns it the value of 5. By default, variables in Rust are immutable (their values cannot change once set). To make a variable mutable, we add `mut` before the variable name. Learn more about [variables and mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability).

```rust
let num = 43;  // immutable
let mut num_mutable = 32; // mutable
```

In the basic program, `let mut name` creates a mutable variable bound to a new instance of a `String`. The `new` function is an associated function of the `String` type that creates a new, empty `String`. `String` is a data type provided by the standard library, representing a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.

#### Receiving User Input and Handling Exceptions
We include the input/output functionality from the standard library with `use std::io` at the top of the program. The code:
```rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut name)
    .expect("Failed to read line");
```
Here, `.read_line(&mut name)` calls the `read_line` method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. `read_line` takes whatever the user types into standard input and appends it to a string, so we pass that string as an argument. The string argument must be mutable so the method can change its content.

The `&` indicates that this argument is a *reference*, allowing multiple parts of the code to access one piece of data without needing to copy it into memory multiple times. We use `&mut name` to make the reference mutable.

`read_line` places the user's input into the string we pass to it and also returns a `Result` value. `Result` is an enumeration (enum), a type that can be one of multiple possible states. `Result` has two variants: `Ok` and `Err`.

- `Ok` indicates the operation was successful, containing the successfully generated value.
- `Err` means the operation failed, containing information about the failure.

Values of the `Result` type have methods defined on them. One such method is `expect`. If the `Result` is an `Err` value, `expect` will cause the program to crash and display the message passed to it. If it is an `Ok` value, the program will continue running.


#### Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the *Cargo.lock* File

Cargo ensures that you can consistently rebuild the same artifact. It will use only the versions of the dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, if version `0.8.6` of the `rand` crate is released next week with an important bug fix but also a regression that breaks your code, your project will not automatically update to `0.8.6`.

When you build a project for the first time, Cargo determines the versions of dependencies that meet your criteria and writes them to the `Cargo.lock` file. On future builds, Cargo will use the versions specified in the `Cargo.lock` file, ensuring reproducible builds. This means your project will remain at `0.8.5` until you explicitly upgrade it, thanks to the `Cargo.lock` file.

### Variables
By default, variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust guves us to write our code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. Howevee, Rust also have option to make variables mutable.

```rust
let x = 5; //immutable variable x
let mut y = 5; //mutable variable y(value can be changed)
```
### Constants
Constants are like immutable variable, that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change. Constants are not just immutable by default, they are always immutable. We declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of `let` keyword, and type of the value *must* be annotated.

Constaant may be set only to constant expression, not the result of a value that could be computed at runtime.
```rust
const HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60*60;
```

#### Shadowing
Although we cannot change the immutable variable, we can declare a new variable with same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable. In effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.


```rust
let a = 5;
let a = a+5; //valid since we are not changing value of variable, we are creating a new variable with same name

let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len(); // store the lenght of spaces

/*
* In mutable variable, we acan update the value of variable, but its value should be same as that as when we defined it.
let mut spaces = "    ";
spaces = spaces.len(); // This will throw an error
*/
```

### Data Types

Rust is a **statically typed** language, which means it requires knowing the types of all variables at compile time.

**Scalar types** represent single values. Rust offers four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters. Integer types are categorized as either signed (`i`) or unsigned (`u`), and their size can vary. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

**Integer Types:**

| Length   | Signed | Unsigned |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 8-bit    | `i8`   | `u8`     |
| 16-bit   | `i16`  | `u16`    |
| 32-bit   | `i32`  | `u32`    |
| 64-bit   | `i64`  | `u64`    |
| 128-bit  | `i128` | `u128`   |
| Arch     | `isize`| `usize`  |

For signed integers, the range is from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$, where $n$ is the number of bits. Unsigned integers range from $0$ to $2^n - 1$. The `isize` and `usize` types adapt to the architecture of your computer: they are 64-bit on a 64-bit architecture and 32-bit on a 32-bit architecture.

**Integer Literals** can be written in various formats:

- **Decimal**: `98_222`
- **Hexadecimal**: `0xff`
- **Octal**: `0o77`
- **Binary**: `0b1111_0000`
- **Byte (u8 only)**: `b'A'`

Be cautious of integer overflow, which occurs when a value exceeds the variable's range. For details on handling overflow and panic modes, refer to the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html).

Rust has two floating point `f64`(double precision) which is default in rust and `f32` which is single precision.

### Loops
In Rust, loops are used to repeat code execution:

1. **`loop`**: Infinite loop, exited with `break`.
   ```rust
   loop {
       println!("Infinite loop");
       break;
   }
   ```

2. **`while`**: Loops while a condition is true.
   ```rust
   let mut x = 0;
   while x < 5 {
       println!("{}", x);
       x += 1;
   }
   ```

3. **`for`**: Iterates over a range or collection.

    - Iterating over a range (exclusive):
    ```rust
    for i in 0..5 { // Iterates over 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
        println!("{}", i);
    }
    ```

    - Iterating over a range (inclusive):
    ```rust
    for i in 0..=5 { // Iterates over 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
        println!("{}", i);
    }
    ```

4. **Control flow**: Use `break` to exit a loop and `continue` to skip an iteration.
   ```rust
   for i in 0..10 {
       if i == 5 { continue; }
       if i == 8 { break; }
       println!("{}", i);
   }
   ```

5. **Loop labels**: For controlling nested loops.
   ```rust
   'outer: for i in 0..3 {
       for j in 0..3 {
           if i == 1 { break 'outer; }
       }
   }
   ```

### Closure
A **closure** in Rust is an anonymous function that can capture and use variables from its surrounding environment. Itâ€™s similar to a regular function, but the key difference is that it can access variables from the scope where it is defined. Closures are a powerful feature in Rust, and they are frequently used for tasks like passing behavior as arguments to functions, deferred execution, and callback functions.

#### **Syntax of a Closure in Rust**

A closure is defined using the `|` symbols for parameters, followed by the closure body. The syntax is as follows:

```rust
|param1, param2| { 
    // Closure body
    // You can use param1, param2, and other captured variables here
}
```

- **No Parameters**:
  ```rust
  let closure = || { println!("No parameters"); };
  closure(); // Calling the closure
  ```

- **With Parameters**:
  ```rust
  let add = |a, b| { a + b };
  println!("{}", add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
  ```

#### **When Are Closures Used in Rust?**

1. **Higher-Order Functions**:
   Closures are often passed as arguments to functions that take a function or a callback. Many methods in Rust's standard library, such as `map`, `filter`, and `fold`, take closures to operate on data structures.

   Example with `map`:
   ```rust
   let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let doubled: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();
   println!("{:?}", doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   ```

   Here, the closure `|x| x * 2` is passed to `map` to double each element in the vector.

2. **Capturing the Environment**:
   One of the defining features of closures in Rust is that they can **capture variables** from the environment in which they are defined. This is different from regular functions, which can only access variables passed explicitly as parameters.

   Example with capturing the environment:
   ```rust
   let x = 5;
   let closure = |y| x + y;
   println!("{}", closure(3)); // Output: 8
   ```
   In this case, the closure captures `x` from the surrounding scope and uses it within the closure body.

3. **Deferred Execution (Lazy Evaluation)**:
   Closures can be used to delay execution, making them useful in scenarios like lazy evaluation or setting up deferred computations.

   Example with deferred execution:
   ```rust
   let closure = || {
       println!("This will be executed later.");
   };
   // The closure is not executed until we call it
   closure();
   ```

4. **Event Handling and Callbacks**:
   Closures are often used as event handlers or callbacks because they can be defined inline and capture the necessary context.

   Example:
   ```rust
   let callback = |x| {
       println!("Callback received: {}", x);
   };
   // Some event triggers the callback
   callback(42); // Output: Callback received: 42
   ```

5. **Asynchronous Code**:
   Closures are commonly used with asynchronous code, where the closure captures data and is passed around for deferred execution when an asynchronous task completes.

   Example:
   ```rust
   use std::thread;

   let closure = |x: i32| x + 1;
   let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
       println!("Result: {}", closure(5)); // Output: Result: 6
   });

   handle.join().unwrap();
   ```

6. **Implementing Custom Functionality for Traits**:
   Closures can also be used to implement custom functionality for traits like `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`. These traits define how a closure can be called and whether it can mutate or take ownership of variables captured from its environment.

#### **Types of Closures in Rust**

Closures are categorized based on how they capture variables from the environment:

1. **`Fn`**: The closure can be called multiple times without modifying the captured variables. It borrows variables from the environment.
2. **`FnMut`**: The closure can be called multiple times, and it **mutates** the captured variables. It has mutable access to the environment.
3. **`FnOnce`**: The closure can be called only once because it takes ownership of the captured variables.

The closure type is inferred by the compiler based on how the variables are captured.

---

### **Example of Closures with Different Types of Capturing**

1. **By Borrowing** (`Fn`):
   ```rust
   let x = 5;
   let closure = || {
       println!("{}", x); // Borrow x
   };
   closure();
   ```

2. **By Mutating** (`FnMut`):
   ```rust
   let mut x = 5;
   let mut closure = || {
       x += 1; // Mutate x
   };
   closure();
   println!("{}", x); // Output: 6
   ```

3. **By Taking Ownership** (`FnOnce`):
   ```rust
   let x = String::from("Hello");
   let closure = move || {
       println!("{}", x); // Takes ownership of x
   };
   closure();
   ```


### FAQ

1. **When should you NOT use a semicolon in Rust?**

   **Answer:** In Rust, you don't need a semicolon when returning a value from a function or closure, as long as the return value is the last expression in the block. If there is no explicit return keyword, the result of the final expression is automatically returned. 

   Example:
   ```rust
   fn calculate() -> i32 {
       let x = 5;
       let y = 10;
       x + y  // No semicolon needed here
   }
   ```

2. **What does the `!` symbol mean in Rust?**

   **Answer:** In Rust, the `!` symbol is used in two primary contexts:
   
   - **Logical NOT operator:** It negates a boolean value.
   - **Macro invocation:** It indicates that something is a macro rather than a function. Macros in Rust are invoked with an exclamation mark following their name.
   
   Some common examples of macros using `!` are:
   
   - `print!`: Prints text to the console without a newline at the end.
     ```rust
     print!("Hello, World!");
     ```
   
   - `println!`: Prints text to the console and appends a newline at the end.
     ```rust
     println!("Hello, World!");
     ```

3. **What are the differences between `println!` and `eprintln!`?**

    | Feature              | `println!`                          | `eprintln!`                        |
    |----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
    | **Output Stream**     | Standard Output (stdout)           | Standard Error (stderr)           |
    | **Buffering**         | Buffered (may not appear immediately) | Unbuffered (appears immediately)  |
    | **Use Case**          | General messages or normal output  | Error messages or diagnostics     |

    Using `eprintln!` for errors and `println!` for regular output allows programs to clearly distinguish between normal output and diagnostic information.

    - **Redirection**:
    - Both `stdout` and `stderr` can be redirected separately in most operating systems:
        - Example:
        ```sh
        ./program > output.log 2> error.log
        ```
        - `stdout` will be saved to `output.log`.
        - `stderr` will be saved to `error.log`.

    To run the program and redirect the output streams:
    ```sh
    $ cargo run > output.txt 2> error.txt
    ```

4. **What are `&` and `*` in Rust?**

    In Rust:

    - **`&`**: Creates a **reference** to a value (borrowing it).
        - `&x` creates an immutable reference to `x`.
        - `&mut x` creates a mutable reference to `x`.

    - **`*`**: **Dereferences** a reference, allowing access to the value it points to.
        - `*y` accesses the value `y` references.

    ### Example:
    ```rust
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;   // Immutable reference to `x`
    println!("{}", *y); // Dereference `y` to access the value (5)
    ```
